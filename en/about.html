                        <h2>A Life of Achievements</h2>
                        <p>
                            Silvano Correa was born in the city of São Paulo in February 1939. From an early age, his life was marked by changes and new experiences that shaped his worldview. He lived in several Brazilian cities — Rio de Janeiro, Volta Redonda, Campinas, Porto Alegre, and Vitória — in addition to spending ten years in the United States, a fundamental period for his formation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Between 1948 and 1954, he lived in New York, and from 1958 to 1962 he studied in Pittsburgh, where he obtained his university degree in Economics and Mathematics from Duquesne University. Those years of immersion in American culture, participating in the daily life of Americans, always with the critical vision of a Brazilian, made him a true citizen of the world.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Professional Career</h2>
                        <p>
                            After returning to Brazil, Silvano began his career at Singer Company and later worked at important multinational companies such as NEC, Addison-Wesley, Harper & Row, and Alexander Proudfoot, traveling throughout Brazil, the United States, and Europe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1980, he took an entrepreneurial step by founding Micro-Total Sistemas, initially a Scopus reseller that was transformed into a software house. The company developed computer programs in the areas of clinic administration, inventory control, and real estate management.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Personal Transformation</h2>
                        <p>
                            In 1975, as a result of overwork and stressful travel — he was a true workaholic — Silvano suffered a cardiac arrest that completely transformed his life. This critical moment led him to rethink his priorities and adopt new paths.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He became a vegetarian (without fanaticism), started practicing martial arts — achieving a black belt (shodan) in Aikido in 1979 after 12 years of intense training — and became a student of Spiritism codified by Allan Kardec. This new orientation opened a horizon of extraordinary spiritual and intellectual richness.
                        </p>

                        <h2>The Legacy of Letters</h2>
                        <p>
                            Over more than six decades, Silvano Correa maintained a constant dialogue with Brazilian society through his letters published in various media outlets. From the Pittsburgh Press to Time magazine, and mainly in the Readers' Forum of O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper, his "My Letters" are expressions of an idealist who believes in the power of ideas and the transformative power of public debate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As he himself expresses: "To dream for dreaming's sake is madness, is fantasy. To dream in order to shape those dreams into great and beautiful works, this is wisdom, is creation, is reality." The hundreds of letters compiled in two volumes represent this lifelong commitment to critical thinking and civic participation.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Defining Moments</h2>
                        <p>
                            Three fateful moments profoundly marked Silvano's life: at age 9, in 1948, falling into the waters of Guanabara Bay when leaving a ferry at Praça XV, when his father heroically rescued him; a near-fatal accident driving a Singer F-100, braking just centimeters from a railway line moments before two locomotives passed at high speed; and a cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation, reversed by a shock at ProCordis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "My time had not come. I had much life and many letters still to write. Until when? Only God knows!"
